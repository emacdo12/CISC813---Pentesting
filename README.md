# CISC813---Pentesting
This project is the term project for CISC813. In this project, we use classical planning to model a pentesting tool on a home network.

## Arguments to run
lamda-first domain.home.pddl problem.home.pddl

## problem.home.pddl
This file contains the initial configuration of the network which is captured in the initial state. It also defines devices that are compromised. The goal state is to compromise specific devices. Feel free to play around.


## domain.home.pddl
In this file, the actions, predicates and types are described. Predicates and types are pretty self explanatory. I will go through each action to describe what kind of attack the actions are modelling.
### dictionary_attack
This attack occurs when the login credentials of a device are insecure. Often, devices use default passwords or weak passwords. This is common exploitation that has led to the success of many botnets. The effect of this action is compromising the security of that device.
### perform_DDoS_attack
This is a distributed denial of service. Many botnets leverage multiple compromised devices to perform a DDoS attack on other machines. It overloads the other machines services so it is unusable.
### arp_spoofing
This is an attack that takes advantage of the ARP protocol (lookup of MAC addresses on the network). If successful, the hub will confuse the attackers machine as the gateway and all traffic will be forwarded to this address.
### port_stealing
Same as arp spoofing, but it for switches.
### RFU_attack
Many devices do no authenticate when updating firmwear. This allows reverse engineer devices and upload their faulty firmwear to the device.
### break_encrypted_keys
If attackers are sniffing other channels, they are able to break the authentication keys through brute force.
### port attacks
When TCP 23 port is left open attackers can exploit this port and compromise the device.
